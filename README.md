# swe-project-2022
Repository for our Software Engineering project, 2022

This repository contains part of the backend code which I handled for a university software engineering project. Its function was to pull the required data from Twitter through the Twitter API, and update our Firebase collection, which was then reflected on the frontend.

It was hosted and run as a worker process on Digital Ocean.
